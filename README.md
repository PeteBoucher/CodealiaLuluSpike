=================

A proof of concept on an in-browser JavaScript interpreter, to be used in developing an interactive code editor to educate young children in coding.

To start the app, run these commands:

~~~
$ bundle install
$ ruby app.rb
~~~

This will start a WEBrick server listening in on `http://localhost:3000`. Code can be added to the editing window and executed using `shift + enter`.
